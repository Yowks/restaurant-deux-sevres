This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

It uses Firebase for authentication. Need to enable `Google` for authentication.

## Getting Started

Make a new file called `.env`\
Paste this inside :

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY = <Put your apiKey>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = <Put your authDomain>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = <Put your projectId>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = <Put your storageBucket>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = <Put your messagingSenderId>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID = <Put your appId>
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
